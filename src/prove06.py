#  Create some type of mechanism to represent your nodes (i.e. neurons) and their
#  associated weights.

#  Provide a way to create a single layer of nodes of any number (this should be
#  easily specified via a parameter).

#  Account for a bias input.

#  Be able to take input from a dataset instance (with an arbitrary number of
#  attributes) and have each node produce an output (i.e., 0 or 1) according to
#  its weights.

#  Be able to load and process at least one dataset of your choice.

#  You should appropriately normalize the data set.
