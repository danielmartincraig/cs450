When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.


1. Please describe your experiment/results for the Vowel dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
  For the vowel dataset, I randomly sampled the data of 48 speakers pronouncing
  each of the 11 syllables, and then predicted the syllable that was being
  pronounced. The SVM did very well, with the best accuracy that I saw being
  97.15 percent accuracy, with gamma = .01 and C = 1*10^7.

2. Please describe your experiment/results for the Letters dataset. How many different parameters did you try? What was the highest accuracy you obtained, and what were the parameters that produced it?
 The letters dataset was more straightforward, because I just grabbed 2/3 of the
 records for training data and left 1/3 for testing. The best accuracy that I
 saw there was 84 percent, which was achieved with gamma = .1 and C = 100.

3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.

 I went above and beyond by learning to use the ggplot2 library, learning to
 wrangle my data as I read the R for Data Science text book, and as I struggled
 to model the original parameters of the syllables problem, as stated on the UCI
 website.

4. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

-E-

5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
 My submission is original, was designed thoughtfully, and represents a lot of
 learning that I did.
