When your assignment is complete, please answer the questions in this text file and upload it to I-Learn.

1. Please provide the URL of your public GitHub repository.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
 The most difficult thing was dealing with missing data, and learning to use
 Pandas dataframes. This I did largely by reading the source, which helped me to
 understand some of the subtleties of the behavior of a dataframe.

3. Briefly describe your process for handling non-numeric data.
 In my experiments, I used the .astype("category") function to correct the
 datatype of columns that were non-numeric.

4. Briefly describe your process for missing data.
 I simply dropped the rows.

5. Describe your results for the Car Evaluation dataset.
 My resulting experiment predicted the class of the car almost suspisciously
 well - perfect accuracy nearly every time. I could find no explanation for
 this.

6. Describe your results for the Pima Indian dataset.
 We didn't use this dataset - we used the Autism data instead. My models
 performed on this data with ~97% accuracy.

7. Describe your results for the Automobile MPG dataset.
 My MPG predictions were off, with an average mean square error of 919. I'm not
 sure how correct it is to average errors, statistically speaking.

8. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond the minimum standard requirements.
 I read a lot of the Pandas source, and I wrote a creative and well-engineered
 solution that reads easily.

9. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

-D-

10. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I met all requirements, and a little more.
